    "1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Functions provide several advantages in programming:\n",
    "    Modularity:\n",
    "        Functions allow you to break down a program into smaller, manageable parts (modules).\n",
    "        Each function performs a specific task, making the code modular and easier to understand.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Reusability:\n",
    "        Once a function is defined, it can be reused in different parts of the program or even in other programs.\n",
    "        Promotes code reuse, reducing redundancy and making maintenance easier.\n",
    "       \n",
    "    Abstraction:\n",
    "        Functions provide a level of abstraction, allowing you to focus on the functionality of a specific task without worrying\n",
    "        about its internal implementation.\n",
    "        Users of the function only need to know how to use it (the function's interface) without understanding its internal\n",
    "        details.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Readability:\n",
    "        Breaking down a program into functions makes the code more readable and easier to follow.\n",
    "        Each function can have a clear, specific purpose, enhancing overall code readability.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Testing and Debugging:\n",
    "        Functions facilitate easier testing and debugging since you can isolate and test individual functions independently.\n",
    "        Bugs in a specific function can be identified and fixed without affecting the rest of the program.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Scoping:\n",
    "        Functions introduce scope, meaning that variables defined inside a function are local to that function, preventing\n",
    "        naming conflicts with variables in other parts of the program.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Parameterization:\n",
    "        Functions can take parameters, allowing you to create more flexible and versatile code that can adapt to different\n",
    "        inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Encapsulation:\n",
    "        Functions provide a way to encapsulate logic, making it easier to understand and manage the overall flow of a program.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    functions enhance code organization, promote reuse, improve readability, and simplify testing and debugging. They are \n",
    "    fundamental building block in creating structured, maintainable, and scalable software."
