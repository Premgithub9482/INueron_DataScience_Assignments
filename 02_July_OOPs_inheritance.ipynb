    "        is often considered straightforward and easy to understand.\n",

    "        Simplicity - Single inheritance tends to be simpler to implement and understand, especially in smaller codebases.\n",
    "        Avoiding Diamond Problem - Single inheritance avoids the diamond problem, which can occur in multiple inheritance when a\n",
